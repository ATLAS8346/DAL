# DAL with disentangled representations
<img src='img/overview.png'>

PyTorch implementation for **Domain agnostic learning with disentangled representations** (ICML2019 Long Oral). This repository contains some code from [Maximum Classifier Discrepancy for Domain Adaptation](https://github.com/mil-tokyo/MCD_DA). If you find this repository useful for you, please also consider cite the MCD paper!

The code has been tested on Python 3.6+PyTorch 0.3 and Python 3.6+PyTorch 0.41. To run the training and testing code, use the following script:

```
python main.py --source=mnist --recordfolder=agnostic_disentangle --gpu=0
```

## Dataset Download
Since many researchers have sent us emails for Digit-Five data. We share the Digit-Five dataset we use in our experiments in the following download link:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A4RJOFj4BJkmliiEL7g9WzNIDUHLxfmm

Keep in mind that the Mnist-M dataset is generated by ourselves, thus this subset may be different from the one released by DANN paper.

If you find the Digit-Five dataset useful for your research, please cite our paper.
